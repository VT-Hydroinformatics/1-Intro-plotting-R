Once you initialize a project in your Rstudio from this repo note the following about the files here.

Plotting_Demo-IN_CLASS.Rmd is the file we will use for class

Plotting_Demo_COMPLETE.Rmd is a filled out version of the IN CLASS demo. This is in case you miss anything. Don't use this for class.

The csv files are the data we are using and you don't need to worry about them.
